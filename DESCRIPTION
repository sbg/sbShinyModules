Description: sbShinyModules is a package designed to simplify the development
  of Shiny applications specifically for hosting on Seven Bridges platforms.
  This package aims to assist both internal and external developers by
  providing pre-built, reusable Shiny modules tailored to fit Seven Bridges
  hosting infrastructure. These modules handle some common tasks such as file
  selection and plot exporting, enabling developers to focus on the unique
  aspects of their applications without needing to research and implement these
  functionalities themselves.
